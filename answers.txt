Answers to the text questions go here.

Part 1, (d) When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of 
text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum).

Answer:
The Flesch-Kincaid readability test may sometimes provide misleading results depending on the type of text being analysed. 

(1) Informal writing like casual conversations or social media content frequently contains sentence fragments, slang, abbreviations. 
These features can skew traditional measures of sentence and word counts, causing the score to be inaccurate and not necessarily reflect how comprehensible
 the writing is.

(2) Texts with technical jargon, such as scientific or medical articles, often include complex terms and words with many syllables. 
This can artificially raise the reading level score, even if the material is easily understandable by the subject matter experts in the field. 

Overall, when working with content that have specialized vocabulary, irregular formats, or informal language, relying solely on the Flesch-Kincaid score
is not advisable.
